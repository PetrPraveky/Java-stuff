                By connecting two vertices you make a line, or \"edge\". By crossing two same edges, thanks to second dimension (you can't do that in 1D), you make on vertex of square.
                When you complete this square by the same technigue, it is named \"face\". Again, if you align three faces with same vertex and bend it
                into third dimension, you create a one vertex of cube. Again by completing this cube, you can name in \"cell\". You can continue and name another objects in
                higher dimensions, but I didn't do that and I only use these four terms. So Vertex mean zero dimensional part of object; Edge is one dimensional part of object of
                certain lenght; Face is two dimensional part of object, square, made of four same edges; And Cell is third dimensional part of object, cube, made of six same
                faces. You can find number of those in higher dimensional cubes later in this document.
